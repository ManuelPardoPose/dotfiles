# Dotfiles
This repository contains all my dotfiles (configs) for software I use.
It will be work in progress


## List of the software that is related to the configs:
- *Neovim <-> nvim*


## Notes for the dotfiles:

- *Neovim*

  If the nvim config does not look like catppuccin on MacOS, the reason might be, that there is no Truecolor support in the standard terminal emulator. Thats why I use alacritty on MacOs. The AutoPairs Plugin is for automatic pair creation when adding brackets and braces. The tree plugin adds a file tree structure viewer, that is super handy when looking at folders.

- *neofetch*

  For neofetch the only change compared to the standard config is the added song display

- *alacritty*

  I have the Font set to JetBrains Mono and the theme set to Catppuccin Mocha.
